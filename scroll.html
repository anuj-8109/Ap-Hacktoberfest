        <p>      <b> Hari Singh Gour was born on 26 November 1870 to a poor family near
            Sagar, in the state of Madhya Pradesh. The family had to be supported by
            Hari Singh's eldest brother who provided an allowance of 50 rupees per
            month. Hari Singh's father was a carpenter,and a farmer but the young boy
            did not have an interest in this trade. At the age of ten, Hari Singh won
            a scholarship of two rupees per month which enabled him to attend a night
            school in Sagar. Later, with the help of another scholarship he went to
            Jabalpur to undertake further studies. Mathematics was his favourite
            subject and for this he received a special prize. <br />
            Jabalpur, he went for his matriculation but he failed in the first time as
            he was deeply disturbed as someone stole his gold ring which he brought by
            saving 10 rupees from all his scholarships. But the second time he passed
            out with good marks. He passed his Intermediate examination from Hislop
            College, Nagpur, a free church institution, standing first in the whole
            province.</b></p>

            Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the
            Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).<br />[1] Web
            development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain
            text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social
            network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web
            development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web
            content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting,
            Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.
            Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main
            non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding.<br />[2]
            Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content
            changes easier and available with basic technical skills. For larger
            organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of
            hundreds of people (Web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile
            methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller organizations may only
            require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary
            assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or
            information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative
            effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated
            department. There are three kinds of Web developer specialization:
            front-end developer, back-end developer,nd full-stack developer.<br />[3]
            Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in
            the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers. Since
            the commercialization of the Web with Tim Berners-Lee <br />[4] developing
            the World Wide Web at CEN, the industry has boomed and has become one of
